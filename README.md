## Introduction

Machine learning algorithms are a core component of data science and artificial intelligence. They allow computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions based on that knowledge. This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of popular machine learning algorithms to foster learning and experimentation.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are currently included in this repository:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forest
5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
6. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
7. K-Means Clustering
8. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
9. Naive Bayes Classifier
10. Feature Engineering

Each algorithm is located in its respective directory and contains a README with details about the algorithm's theory, implementation details, and usage.

## Installation

To use the algorithms in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AngadiAbhinay01/Machine_Learning_Algorithms.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```
   cd Machine_Learning_Algorithms
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Choose the algorithm you want to use and navigate to its directory:

   ```
   cd algorithm_name
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the algorithm's README to run and experiment with it.

## Usage

Each algorithm comes with its own set of usage instructions and examples in its respective directory's README file. Generally, you can import the algorithm as a Python module and use its methods for training and prediction.

For example, to use the Linear Regression algorithm:

```python
from linear_regression import LinearRegression

# Create a Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Provide training data (X_train) and corresponding labels (y_train)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on new data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
